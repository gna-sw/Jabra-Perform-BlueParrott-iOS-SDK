 The main interface to the BlueParrott Headset.
 
 To instantiate, just use `sharedInstance`:
 
     BPHeadset *headset = [BPHeadset sharedInstance];
 
 To connect, set a listener that conforms to the [BPHeadsetListener](BPHeadsetListener) protocol, then call connect:
 
    // ViewController.h
    @interface ViewController : UIViewController <BPHeadsetListener>
         // ...
    @end
 
    // ViewController.m
    @implementation ViewController
      - (void)viewDidLoad {
        [super viewDidLoad];
        headset = [BPHeadset sharedInstance];
        [headset addListener:self];
      }
 
      - (IBAction)connectButtonTouched:(id)sender {
        [headset connect];
      }
    @end
 
 
 Then simply implement the methods from [BPHeadsetListener](BPHeadsetListener) that you are interested in:
 
    @implementation ViewController
      // ...
 
    #pragma mark BPHeadsetListener methods
      - (void) onConnect {
        // Update UI
 
        // Enable SDK Mode
        [headset enableSDKMode];
      }
 
      - (void) onConnectFailure:(BPConnectError) resonCode {
        // Inform the user
      }
 
      - (void) onDisconnect {
        // e.g. headset was powered off
      }
 
      - (void) onButtonDown:(BPButtonID) buttonID {
        // Button was pushed down, start recording...
      }
 
      - (void) onButtonUp:(BPButtonID) buttonID {
        // Button was released, stop recording...
